The code can use two different solvers.
Either use minisat or maxsat as an argument.
To parse a file of the Datasets use the following code

python3 parse.py minisat Dataset_a/sig3_5_15/srs_0.txt         

The output will be the KnowledgeBase in CNF, followed by the atoms, the formulas and the format of the KnowledgeBase.
